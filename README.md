# Partial Ordering, dependent graph, and scheduling (Java)

Given a directed acyclic (dependency) graph, G = <N, E>,
the task is to construct a schedule table based on the given dependency
of nodes (jobs) in the graph. The program includes the following four cases for scheduling:
(1)using limited processor where each job takes only 1 unit of time;
(2)using unlimited processor where each job takes only 1 unit of time;
(3)using limited processor where jobs take variable unit of times;
(4)using unlimited processor where jobs take variable unit of times.
